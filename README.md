This is the beginning

Hello Future Jaemie,

You signed up for this because you are tired of your job at Woori America Bank.
Tired of waking up at 6, wearing a suit, leaving at 7:10, going to work in a Korean company where you can't 
communicate (even though everyone is super nice and you love them).
Tired of the less than stellar pay.
Tired of the lack of potential.
Tired of doing something you don't even mildly enjoy.
And nothing else is working.
General Assembly is a start but it proves nothing.

Learn by doing.
